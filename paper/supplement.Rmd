**Figure `r table_supp_collection`.**
The master mixes were sequenced across four flow cells.
"Bulk" is a master mix of the bulk samples from each of the nine batches (3 individuals x 3 replicates).
The other master mixes contain the libraries for the 96 single cells from one Fluidigm C1 chip.
The master mixes for the three individuals were partitioned across the four flow cells to avoid introducing bias.
