## Introduction

Single-cell genomic technologies can be used to study the regulation of gene expression at unprecedented resolution [@Macaulay2014; @Saliba2014]. 
Using single-cell gene expression data, we can begin to effectively characterize and classify individual cell types and cell states, develop a better understanding of gene regulatory threshold effects in response to treatments or stress, and address a large number of outstanding questions that pertain to the regulation of noise and robustness of gene expression programs. 
Indeed, single cell gene expression data have already been used to study and provide unique insight into a wide range of research topics, including differentiation and tissue development [@Macosko2015; @Handel2016; @Drissen2016], the innate immune response [@Shalek2013; @Jaitin2014], and pharmacogenomics [@Miyamoto2015; @Kim2015].

Yet, there are a number of outstanding challenges that arose in parallel with the application of single cell technology [@Stegle2015].
A fundamental difficulty, for instance, is the presence of inevitable technical variability introduced during sample processing steps, including but not limited to the conditions of mRNA capture from a single cell, amplification bias, sequencing depth, and variation in pipetting accuracy. 
These (and other sources of error) may not be unique to single cell technologies, but in the context of studies where each sample corresponds to a single cell, and is thus processed as a single unrepeatable batch, these technical considerations make the analysis of biological variability across single cells particularly challenging.

To better account for technical variability in scRNA-seq experiments, it has become common to add spike-in RNA standards of known abundance to the endogenous samples [@Brennecke2013; @Grun2014]. 
The most commonly used spike-in was developed by the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) [@Jiang2011]; comprising of a set of 96 RNA controls of varying length and GC content.
A number of single cell studies focusing on analyzing technical variability based on ERCC spike-in controls have been reported [@Brennecke2013; @Grun2014; @Ding2015; @Vallejos2015]. 
However, one principle problem with spike-ins is that they do not ‘experience’ all processing steps that the endogenous sample is subjected to. 
For that reason, it is unknown to what extent the spike-ins can faithfully reflect the error that is being accumulated during the entire sample processing procedure, either within or across batches.
In particular, amplification bias, which is assumed to be gene-specific, cannot be addressed by spike-in normalization approaches. 

To address challenges related to the efficiency and uniformity with which mRNA molecules are amplified and sequenced in single cells, unique molecule identifiers (UMIs) were introduced to single cell sample processing [@Kivioja2011; @Fu2011; @Casbon2011; @Shiroguchi2012].
The rationale is that by counting molecules rather than the number of amplified sequencing reads, one can account for biases related to amplification, and obtain more accurate estimates of gene expression levels [@Jaitin2014; @Islam2014; @Grun2014].
It is assumed that most sources of variation in single cell gene expression studies can be accounted for by using the combination of UMIs and a spike-in based standardization [@Islam2014; @Vallejos2015].
Nevertheless, though molecule counts, as opposed to sequencing read counts, are associated with substantially reduced levels of technical variability, a non-negligible proportion of experimental error remains unexplained.

There are a few common platforms in use for scRNA-seq. 
The automated C1 microfluidic platform (Fluidigm), while more expensive per sample, has been shown to confer several advantages over platforms that make use of droplets to capture single cells [@Wu2014; @Macosko2015].
In particular, smaller samples can be processed using the C1 (when cell numbers are limiting), and the C1 capture efficiency of genes (and RNA molecules) is markedly higher.
Notably, in the context of this study, the C1 system also allows for direct confirmation of single cell capture events, in contrast to most other microfluidic-based approaches [@Macosko2015; @Klein2015].
One of the biggest limitations of using the C1 system, however, is that single cell capture and preparation from different conditions are fully independent [@Hicks2015].
Consequently, multiple replicates of C1 collections from the same biological condition are necessary to facilitate estimation of technical variability even with the presence of ERCC spike-in controls [@Stegle2015]. 
To our knowledge, to date, no study has been purposely conducted to assess the technical variability across batches on the C1 platform.

To address this gap, we collected scRNA-seq data from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines of three Yoruba individuals (abbreviation: YRI) using C1 microfluidic plates. 
Specifically, we performed three independent C1 collections per each individual to disentangle batch effects from the biological covariate of interest, which, in this case, is the difference between individuals.
Both ERCC spike-in controls and UMIs were included in our sample processing.
With these data, we were able to elucidate technical variability both within and between C1 batches and thus provide a deep characterization of cell-to-cell variation in gene expression levels across individuals.
