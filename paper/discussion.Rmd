## Discussion
### Summary

### Design and QC
UMI, ERCC, technical and biological replicates, 

### Molecule number 
absolute number, relative number, sequencing depth

### Read to molecule conversion
vary across samples, batch effect, individual effect

### ERCC spike-ins
filter low quality sample, techcnical variability across sample, and cellular content

### Pipeline
collision probability, standardization, normalization, and batch correction

### Cell to cell variation of gene expression
measure of noise level, identify different distribution patterns, pluripotency genes
