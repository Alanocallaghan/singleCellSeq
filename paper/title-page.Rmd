## Abstract

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to characterize variation in gene expression levels at high resolution.
Using single cell gene expression profiling, one can identify novel cell types and characterize inter-cell variability in response to external signals. 
The technology that enables scRNA-seq is relatively new, and we are still actively learning the different sources of experimental noise that are being introduced during single cell sample processing. 
To investigate the sources of technical variation introduced during scRNA-seq using the Fluidigm C1 platform, we collected three replicates of the C1 chip from three human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. 
We added unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to reduce the bias inherent in amplifying and sequencing a small starting amount of RNA.
As expected, we observed that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by biological variation (i.e. the differences between the three individuals), but we also substantial technical variation between the replicates of each individual.
In contrast to common notion, we observed that the conversion of reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological and technical variation, indicating that UMI counts cannot assumed to be an unbiased estimator of gene expression levels.
After accounting for these technical sources of variation using a linear mixed model framework, we identified 330 genes whose variation in single cell expression levels were different across the three individuals. 
Based on our observations, we suggest a framework for an effective scRNA-seq study design.
