## Figure Legends

### Figure 1. Experimental design and quality control of scRNA-seq.
\(A\) Three C1 96 well-integrated fluidic circuit (IFC) replicates were collected from each of the three Yoruba individuals.
Bulk sample was included each time.
(B) Summary of the cutoffs used to filter out data from low quality cells that might be ruptured or dead (See Figure `r fig_supp_qc` for details).
(C-E) To assess the quality of the single cell RNA-seq data, the capture efficiency of cells and the faithfulness of mRNA fraction amplification were determined based on the proportion of unmapped reads, the number of detected genes, the numbers of total mapped reads, and the proportion of ERCC spike-in reads across cells. 
The dash lines indicate the cutoffs summarized in (B). 
The three colors represent the three individuals (NA19098 in red, NA19101 in green, and NA19239 in blue), and the numbers indicate the cell numbers observed in each capture site on C1 plate. 
(F) Scatterplots in log scale showing the mean read counts and the mean molecule counts of each endogenous gene (grey) and ERCC spike-ins (blue) from high quality single cell samples (`r nrow(anno_filter)` cells) before removal of genes with low expression. 
(G) mRNA capture efficiency shown as observed molecule count versus number of spike-in molecules of each ERCC RNA transcript, after removal of genes with low expression (`r sum(grepl("ERCC", rownames(molecules_filter)))` ERCC transcripts left). 
Each red dot represents the mean (and SEM) of an ERCC transcript across `r nrow(anno_filter)` cells.

### Figure 2. The effect of sequencing depth and cell number on single cell UMI estimates.
Sequencing reads from single cells were subsampled to the indicated sequencing depth and cell number, and subsequently converted to molecules using the UMIs. Each point represents the mean +/- SEM of 10 random draws of the indicated cell number. 
The left panel displays the results for 6,097 (50% of detected) genes with lower expression levels  and the right panel the results for 6,097 genes with higher expression levels.
\(A\) Pearson correlation of aggregated gene expression level estimates from single cells compared to the bulk sequencing samples.
(B) Total number of genes detected with at least one molecule in at least one of the single cells.
(C) Pearson correlation of cell-to-cell gene expression level variance estimates from subsets of single cells compared to the full single cell data set.

### Figure 3. Batch effect of scRNA-seq data using the C1 platform.
\(A\) Violin plots of the number of total ERCC spike-in molecule-counts in thousands in single cell samples by C1 replicate.
(B) Scatterplot of the total ERCC molecule-counts and total gene molecule-counts.
(C and D) Violin plots of the reads to molecule conversion efficiency (total molecule-counts divided by total read-counts per single cells) by C1 replicate.
The endogenous genes and the ERCC spike-ins are shown separately in (E) and (F), respectively.
There is significant difference across individuals of both endogenous genes (*P* < 0.001) and ERCC spike-ins (*P* < 0.05).
The difference across C1 replicates per individual is also evaluated (*** indicates *P* < 0.001).
The colors represent the three individuals (NA19098 is in red, NA19101 in green, and NA19239 in blue).
Data from different C1 replicates is plotted in different shapes.

(B) PCA of gene expression data after cpm standardization followed by log2 transformation.
(C) PCA of gene expression data using the Poisson- normalized molecule numbers.
(D) PCA of gene expression data using the batch-corrected molecule numbers.
The colors represent the three individuals (NA19098 in red, NA19101 in green, and NA19239 in blue).
Data from different C1 replicates is plotted in different shapes.

### Figure 5. Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression.
Adjusted CV (see Method) plotted against average molecule counts across all cells in (A) and across only the cells in which the gene is expressed (B), including data from all three individuals. 
Each dot represents a gene, and the color indicates the corresponding gene-specific dropout rate (the proportion of cells in which the gene is undetected). 
(C and D) Venn diagrams showing the overlaps of top 1000 genes across individuals based on mean expression level in (C) and based on adjusted CV values in (D), considering only the cells in which the gene is expressed. 
(E and F) Similarly, Venn diagrams showing the overlaps of top 1000 genes across individuals based on mean expression level in (E) and based on adjusted CV values in (F), across all cells.

### Figure 6. Inter-individual differences in regulatory noise.
Selected genes are shown in the upper panel, the distribution of log2 gene expression levels, considering only cells in which the gene is detected as expressed.
In the middle panel, the proportion of cells in which the gene is detected as expressed (dark grey) and the dropout rate (light grey) for each individual.
In the lower panel, the absolute value of adjusted CV for each individual, along with the corresponding gene-specific MAD (median of absolute deviation) value, and the *P* value. 
The three colors in the upper and lower panel represent the individuals (NA19098 in red, NA19101 in green, and NA19239 in blue).
