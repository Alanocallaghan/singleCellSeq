The third of four flow cells was sequenced at the Functional Genomics Facility (FGF).
Here is the message from Pieter Faber:

> We finished Flowcell #3 of your Illumina sequencing experiment (4 flowcells SR100). No technical problem were encountered. I attached several QC files in support.
>
> I have uploaded the data in fastq format to the Genomics Core ftp server data server (gilad Lab folder, folder = /NGS/150402_700819F_0305_AC723YACXX-YG-SR100-FC-3).

To download, need to preface `/NGS` with `/Genomics_Data`.

```bash
cd /mnt/gluster/data/internal_supp/singleCellSeq/raw
echo "wget --user=gilad --password='<password>' -r ftp://fgfftp.uchicago.edu/Genomics_Data/NGS/150402_700819F_0305_AC723YACXX-YG-SR100-FC-3/" \
| qsub -l h_vmem=2g -N fc3 -cwd -V -j y -o 150402_700819F_0305_AC723YACXX-YG-SR100-FC-3.log
```

The download took ~11.5 hours.
It started at 15:45:53 and ended at 03:18:37.
However, `wget` reported that it only took ~6.5 hours.
Here's the final line of output:

> Downloaded: 1376 files, 112G in 6h 24m 35s (4.96 MB/s)

To remove the unnecessary directories from the FGF FTP site, I moved the files.

```
mv fgfftp.uchicago.edu/Genomics_Data/NGS/150402_700819F_0305_AC723YACXX-YG-SR100-FC-3 150402_700819F_0305_AC723YACXX-YG-SR100-FC-3
rmdir -p fgfftp.uchicago.edu/Genomics_Data/NGS/
```

Next I removed the extraneous CASAVA directories and added the flow cell name to the filename.

```bash
cd -
```

I did this with the following Python code:

```python
import glob
import shutil

files = glob.glob('raw/150402_700819F_0305_AC723YACXX-YG-SR100-FC-3/FastQ/Project_YG-SR100-3/Sample*/*fastq.gz')

target_dir = 'fastq/'
log = open('rearrange_C723YACXX.log', 'w')
log.write('original\tnew\n')

for f in files:
    path = f.strip('fastq.gz').split('/')
    flow_cell = path[1].split('_')[-1][1:10]
    file_parts = path[-1].split('_')[:-1]
    new_name = target_dir + '.'.join(file_parts + [flow_cell]) + '.fastq.gz'
    log.write(f + '\t' + new_name + '\n')
    shutil.move(f, new_name)

log.close()
```
